# Verification

Phase 0 acceptance criteria from [PRD.md](../PRD.md), with the evidence gathered on 2026-11-05 on branch `p0-foundation` (macOS, Apple M4 Max, Metal GPU backend).

## P0 acceptance

| ID | Criterion | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0-A1 | `make checkall`, `make checkall-ci` and `make e2e` are green on a fresh clone. `make dev`, `make dev-stop` and `make dev-restart` work on port 4252. | `make checkall-ci` exit 0 (includes checkall: lint, typecheck, 12 test files with 100 tests passing, build, bundle-check; then `gitleaks dir` and `gitleaks git` with no leaks over 34 commits, `bun audit` with no vulnerabilities, `asset-check` with 21 files verified). `make e2e E2E_PORT=4283` exit 0, 4 of 4 Playwright tests passed. Fresh clone (2026-11-05, `git clone` of 0424b5f into /tmp, then `make install`): `make checkall-ci` exit 0 (100 tests), `make e2e E2E_PORT=4293` exit 0 (4 of 4). Dev half: `make dev` answered HTTP 200 on 4252, `make dev-stop` printed "Stopped; port 4252 is free." and `lsof` showed no listener, `make dev-restart` answered HTTP 200 again. | Met |
| P0-A2 | The e2e suite boots IWER `metaQuest3`, enters an immersive session, presses a controller trigger, and reads `__goghDiag()`. The production bundle contains no IWER code, checked by a bundle grep in `checkall`. | `tests/e2e/harness.spec.ts` "IWER Quest 3 enters immersive VR and reports a right-trigger press" passed in the e2e run (renderer `ANGLE Metal Renderer: Apple M4 Max`). `bundle-check` printed "dist/ contains no IWER code" inside `make checkall-ci`. | Verified |
| P0-A3 | The desktop preview walks a ground plane with WASD and mouse. | Unit coverage in `tests/walk.test.ts` and `tests/controls.test.ts` passed within the 100 tests. The e2e `setPose` test moves the camera. No interactive desktop session was run in this round. Since P3.2, WASD walking runs through locomotion: `tests/locomotion*.test.ts` and `tests/e2e/locomotion.spec.ts` cover it, and `tests/walk.test.ts` covers mouse look only. | Verified by unit tests, interactive check not run |
| P0-A4 | `assets/PROVENANCE.md` lists all 7 scans with file name, URL, license, painting version and SHA-256. Committed runtime derivatives are a 1024 px `frame.webp` per painting. The Starry Night bake input is the 3840 px source scan in `assets/scans/`, which is never served. A frame that fails vetting is recorded as a placeholder. | `bun scripts/asset-check.ts` printed "asset-check: 21 files verified" and passed inside `make checkall-ci`. It recomputes every hash, requires a row for each painting scan and frame, and now fails on any file under `assets/` or `public/paintings/` that has no row. | Verified |
| P0-A5 | The live site at `https://gogh-xr.pardev.net` renders the bare scene in a browser, verified by a live render, not an HTTP 200. | 2026-11-05, deploy of 342252d (Pages run 42138613476 green, CI run 42138613489 green). In a browser, `https://gogh-xr.pardev.net/?diag` rendered the bare scene (night sky, ground grid, "VR not available" notice). `__goghDiag()` returned build 0.1.0, 181 frames, 2 draw calls on ANGLE Metal. No console errors, and `__goghIwer` is undefined in production. HTTPS certificate approved and enforced. | Met |
| P0-A6 | Headset check. The owner runs the benchmark on the Quest 3. `docs/perf.md` records the measured stroke counts at which 72, 90 and 120 Hz hold, `supportedFrameRates`, timer-query availability, and alpha-to-coverage vs blended cost. The P1 budgets are updated from these numbers. | Run by Paul on 2026-11-05 at fd7a1ab and 7a4de62. `docs/perf.md` records full-sphere counts at 72, 80, 90 and 120 Hz for both modes, `supportedFrameRates` [72, 80, 90, 120], the GPU timer as unavailable, the a2c vs blend cost and look, and foveation. The P1 budget table in `plans/phase-1-stroke-engine.md` is updated from them. One data point remains unmeasured and is listed in `perf.md`. Paul signed off on 2026-11-05. | Met |

## P1 acceptance

Evidence for the Phase 1 criteria from [PRD.md](../PRD.md), gathered on branch `p1-stroke-engine` (macOS, Apple M4 Max, Metal GPU backend).

| P1-A2 | A test canvas (the scan on a plane, painted in strokes) is recognizably the painting in the desktop preview, captured with `?shot`. | 2026-11-05, commit bd3bb84, production build served by `vite preview`. Captured `/?diag&shot&demo=canvas&noanim&seed=1` at 1600 × 1200 with `bun scripts/capture-shot.ts <url> docs/shots/p1-canvas.png --wait canvas` (headless Chromium, ANGLE Metal). The canvas holds 200,359 strokes in 56 chunks, all near band and all visible. On the M4 Max the build took 169 ms: 80 ms decode, 57 ms placement, 32 ms batch, with the 176 ms brush atlas counted separately. Quest CPU time is not measured yet. A second capture with no `?seed` was byte-identical. For the comparison, the canvas region of the shot (pixels (128, 67) to (1472, 1133), from the camera and canvas geometry) and the scan (inset 12 px at the sides and 4 px at top and bottom, matching the colour sampling) were both downscaled with Lanczos to 256 px wide. The mean absolute RGB difference is 7.8 of 255, and mean lightness matches (92.0 vs 92.3). These figures came from a one-off comparison script that is not in the repo. Shots and comparison are below. Paul reviewed the shot against the scan and signed off on 2026-11-06. | Met |

### P1-A2 shot

| `?demo=canvas` shot, seed 1 | Scan reference (`frame.webp`) |

| ![Test canvas painted in strokes](shots/p1-canvas.png) | ![Starry Night scan](shots/p1-canvas-scan.webp) |

Detail at 100%: ![Moon and stars detail](shots/p1-canvas-detail.png)

At a glance the shot is the painting. The swirls follow the flow field, including the large central double swirl. The stars and the crescent moon read as concentric rings of short strokes. The cypress reads as dark vertical flames, and the village keeps the church spire, the lit windows and the roof lines. Colour and value match the scan closely, because each stroke averages three samples of the scan along its own length.

Several things do not read as the painting.
- The strokes are finer and more uniform than Van Gogh's. A visible stroke fragment is about 1–3 cm on a 4 m canvas, so up close the sky reads as a mosaic of short dabs, not his long continuous ribbons. Longer sky strokes were tried (7 spacings instead of 5.2). They looked more painterly but blurred the dark swirl outlines, and the sky's difference from the scan rose from 9.5 to 12.1, so they were rejected.
- Heavy overlap hides most of each stroke. The painted area per stroke is about 5× its grid cell where the flow is flat and up to 12× in coherent swirls. As a result, the brush shapes show mainly as stroke ends.
- The canvas edge is ragged within about one stroke spacing (9 mm), because strokes centre on the canvas.

## P2 acceptance

Evidence for the Phase 2 criteria from [PRD.md](../PRD.md), gathered on branch `worktree-p2-starry-night` (macOS, Apple M4 Max, Metal GPU backend).

| ID | Criterion | Evidence | Status |

| P2-A1 | Generators are deterministic for a given seed (unit snapshot of vertex and stroke counts and bounds). | 2026-11-06, commit 4768e33. `tests/world-starry-night.test.ts` pins the seed-1 world as literals, over the real `CanvasSource` (frame.webp, regions.png and flow.png decoded with sharp). Generators: vertex and triangle counts and axis-aligned bounds rounded to 1 mm for the terrain (16,384 vertices, 32,258 triangles), ridge, houses, roofs, windows, church, cypress and sky dome. Scatter: the `scatterWorld` total (535,011), the per-layer counts and its `hashStrokeBuffers` (`9724bad8`). Haze: 30,000 strokes, hash `49bf0339`. Both tests pass inside `make checkall`. A scatter pin change requires a `SCATTER_VERSION` bump. A generator pin change does not, because the cache key carries the build SHA. | Met |
| P2-A2 | The painter's spot screenshot (`?shot`, `?noanim`, fixed seed) is compared to the reference scan with the downscaled perceptual metric defined in the P2 plan, and its threshold is set and recorded here. | 2026-11-06, commit bf9d9a9, production build served by `vite preview`. URL `/?painting=starry-night&diag&shot&noanim&seed=1&painter` (`?painter` puts the desktop camera on the painter camera, so the frame is exactly canvas uv [0, 1]²). Captured at 1280 × 1014 (the canvas aspect) with `bun scripts/fidelity.ts --url "<url>" --capture docs/shots/p2-painter-spot.png`, which runs `scripts/capture-shot.ts --size 1280x1014 --wait world` (headless Chromium, ANGLE Metal). Metric (`scripts/fidelity-lib.ts`): the scan `assets/scans/starry-night.jpg` is inset past its mat by the colour-sampling inset (45 px at the sides, 15 px at top and bottom), and both images go to 256 × 203 with sharp Lanczos in sRGB. SSIM is Wang et al. 2004 on Rec. 709 luma of the gamma-encoded sRGB values (11 × 11 Gaussian, σ 1.5, K1 0.01, K2 0.03, L 255, valid windows). ΔE is the mean CIEDE2000 over 16 × 12 block-mean colours averaged in linear light, CIELAB under D65. Measured **SSIM 0.2943** and **mean ΔE2000 5.6961**. The e2e build gives the same values to 4 decimals. The worst blocks (column, row from the top-left) are (14, 2) 51.4, (11, 11) 43.2, (15, 2) 35.3, (14, 1) 33.5 and (5, 6) 30.9: the moon three times, one near lit window, and the large star left of the swirl. Margin rule: the measured values are rounded to 4 decimals, then SSIM threshold = measured − 0.03 and ΔE threshold = measured + 1.5, giving **SSIM ≥ 0.2643** and **mean ΔE2000 ≤ 7.1961**. They are the exported constants `SSIM_THRESHOLD` and `DELTA_E_THRESHOLD`, and `tests/e2e/fidelity.spec.ts` asserts both. Determinism: a second capture was byte-identical (SHA-256 `960a0b8e…ba57`). A framing check found the capture's best shift against the scan at (0, 0) of a ±3 px search at 64 px wide. The thresholds are Paul accepted them on 2026-11-06 as the regression floor. He judges the look itself in the headset at P2.9 (P2-A4). | Met |
| P2-A3 | Every world surface is stroke-covered, with no bare mesh visible from any point inside the boundary, checked by an e2e sweep of sample poses that counts background-colour pixels. | `tests/e2e/world-coverage.spec.ts` renders 24 poses with `?painting=starry-night&noanim&seed=1&shot&coverage` at 1280 × 720 and fails a pose over 0.5% bare. Maximum binary bare share 0.442% at hill west. The sweep renders through the 70° vertical desktop camera, which is narrower than the Quest 3's roughly 96° vertical view, so the edges of a headset view are not checked here. Widening the sweep is deferred, and the gap is recorded here. The coverage-weighted share, which also counts MSAA rims, peaks at 0.591% at hill west and is logged as telemetry only (ruling P21). The same figures came out of the P2.8 `make e2e` run on 2026-11-06. | Met |

### P2-A2 shot

Scan, capture and ΔE heat map (black 0, red 10, yellow 20 and above), each at 256 × 203 shown at 2×:

![Scan, painter-spot capture and ΔE heat map](shots/p2-fidelity.png)

Full capture: ![Painter-spot capture, seed 1](shots/p2-painter-spot.png)

SSIM is low because the comparison is luma structure at 256 px, where the scan's fine brushwork and the world's 1.8× strokes differ in texture everywhere. The threshold therefore catches gross breakage, such as lost framing, a missing cypress or a blank region, not subtle drift. The block ΔE carries the colour match. Visible gaps in this render, none of them tuned for P2.8:
- The stars and the moon are absent. Their rings are P4.3, so `world.counts` shows `star` and `moon` at 0, and the metric can only improve when they land.
- The distant ridge band on the right (v_down 0.50–0.72) reads as sky strokes, so blocks (15, 6) and (15, 7) are hot.
- The village houses are not legible as houses, and the church reads as a pale ghost.
- One near lit window reads as a large cream blob at the bottom, block (11, 11).
